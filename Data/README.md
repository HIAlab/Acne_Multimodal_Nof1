The study is conducted over a period of 16 days, and the acne images and associated metadata is recorded. Each participant applied the treatment according to a specified schedule on spots of facial or body acne, three times a day. For each participant, images were taken three times a day after the applied treatment for a continuous period of 16 days â€“ right after waking up, right after second meal of day, and right before bedtime, respectively. The time to collect data was dependent on the daily schedule of each participant to allow for comparable results across participants. The 16-day study consisted of 4 four-day blocks, where each participant collected data first for two days without treatment and then two days with the treatment(some participants had a few extra days).
